# (libgbm, libnss3, etc) via apt.

# Do NOT add a separate `npx playwright install --with-deps chromium` here: stable
# playwright pins a DIFFERENT revision (1234), so it downloads ~656 MB of browsers
# that are never launched. PLAYWRIGHT_SKIP_BROWSER_DOWNLOAD=1 does not prevent this —
# that variable is only read by the npm-postinstall path, not the explicit `install`.
